>Template (There is the Complete Template for landpage web with catalog and simplified web for just only Catalog)

>Web_output folder is where the final result go, export the template with Client info.

It export with client name __html__ file, if you wish use it online change the name to __index.html__

Also you can change the template by your own template just adding the variables on it using Jinja2 guide or just check how is done in the current Template.
